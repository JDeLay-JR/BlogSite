Hello! Thanks for stopping by and taking time to read our blog; we appreciate you!

I want to preface this article by stating that a framework is, in its simplest form, a tool that allows a developer to accomplish a task. This article is not meant to praise or belittle either React or Vue because I think they are both great in their own unique ways. What I want to try and do is walk a new developer through configuring each type of application, delve into some more advanced concepts like building with components, and highlight the similarities and the differences between these two great frameworks. With that being said let's learn the history behind React and Vue.

## Vue

Vue was created in 2014 by Evan You, a software engineer at Google. You was inspired by Angular.js which is Google's component based framework. He wanted to extract all the awesome parts of Angular to create a framework that can be created using components, much like React. In addition, You wanted to create an extremely lightweight framework and thus Vue was born.

### Steps to Get Started with Vue


## Similarities
 - Virtual DOM
 - Component building blocks
 - Lifecycle Hooks

## Differences
- Templating
- Vue as a web component in existing project
- Injecting/displaying data in the component
