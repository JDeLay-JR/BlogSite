# Introduction

Hello! Thanks for stopping by and taking time to read our blog; we appreciate you!

I want to preface this article by stating that a framework is, in its simplest form, a tool that allows a developer to accomplish a task. This article is not meant to praise or belittle either of these two frameworks because I think they are both great in their own unique ways. What I want to try and do is highlight the similarities and the differences between these two frameworks and provide use cases for each.

With that being said let me give a little background story behind these two frontend frameworks.

React history
Vue history

What are they both? Talk about component based approach to front end

# Hello World

Alright so now that we know a little bit about each of these frameworks I want to start off with the classic and timeless Hello World example so we can see the simplest form of both a React and Vue application. From there we will create a few simple components to demonstrate ***the composition*** of these libraries Let's begin with React using the Create React App!

## Steps to Get Started with React

Fire up your favorite terminal and type in the following: `npm -i -g create-react-app` or **`yarn install global create-react-app`**. This will install the create-react-app command line tool which will allow you to easily install boilerplate and start a new React project. The `create-react-app` CLI is really awesome so if you'd like to learn more about it click [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). After you have installed the CLI tool navigate to a directory where you'd like to start your project. In our case you can enter the following in your terminal: `cd /Documents && create-react-app hello-world`. This will create a folder called `hello-world` in your Documents directory. Now navigate into `hello-world` and install all the dependencies using `npm i` or **`yarn start`**.

For the purpose of this article we'll only be concerned with the following files:

- `index.html` in the public folder
- `App.js` in the src folder
- `index.js` in the src folder


## Steps to Get Started with Vue


## Similarities
 - Lifecycle Hooks
 - Virtual DOM

## Differences
- Templating
- Vue as a web component in existing project
- Injecting/displaying data in the component

Maybe a follow up article about state management and routing?
